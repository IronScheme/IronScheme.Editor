0.1       - November 22, 2005

- After 2 1/2 years of on and off development, I present the 1st milestone release for xacc.ide. 

0.1-rc6   - November 20, 2005

- Mostly bugfixes, and 2 new tools added in the installer, flex and xyacc. flex is just a binary 
  of an unmodified flex distribution compressed with UPX. xyacc is a heavily modified version of 
	byacc, to emit C# code and headers for flex. I renamed it to prevent confusion, as it will 
	likely only work on xacc (as it is intended to)! xyacc is also UPX compressed. These 2 new tools 
	adds ~100kb to the installer . Unfortunately the dependency sorter is not working yet, so they
	cant be used just yet.
 
-	Also some enhancements to the installer, and removed 'non working' highlighters.

0.1-rc5   - November 16, 2005

-	Mainly embarrasing bugs fixes and toolbar implemented (about 15 lines total, excluding 
	attributes, fits beautifully with the menu system). 

0.1-rc4   - November 13, 2005

- Prelimenary support for .nsi files 
- 500 xml doc warnings eliminated (300 remaining), now people can figure out at least what all these functions do! 
- Toolbar is broken (on purpose) 
- Some menu items are gone (but not forgotten) 
- Added .NET 1.1 check and download to installer

0.1-rc3   - November 11, 2005

New:
- Busy on a new stateful attributed menu system. Basically placing an attribute on a method will 
  create a menu item for that method, with some extra options. The menus are not complete so dont 
  complain about them yet. 

Improved:
- GetArgs now accepts 'default' arguments, parsing improved.

Fixed:
- Ctrl + 'key' issue.

Known issues:
- Opening a project when an exisiting one is open, causes a long stall.

0.1-rc2   - November 07, 2005

Fixed: 
- Tab issue, works perfectly now 

Improved:
- Project support/handling

New:
- Dynamically generated TreeView 'icons' based on action 

0.1-rc1   - November 05, 2005

NEW:
- Debugger support (mainly C#) (TIP: use VS.NET F-keys) 
- Many memory and speed improvements, code clean up, shrunk xacc.dll by 100kb  
- Heavily improved project/build system (multiple projects still lacks), brand new minimal 
- xml project files 
- C# preprocessor (cspp) 
- Brand new XML build system (see config.xml). This file get compiled into a .NET assembly 
  to provide info to various parts of the project, as well as invocation of the actions, and 
  provides XML serialization support, as well as project property configuration dialogs and 
  error parsing, etc, etc,... you get the picture 

- Startup options (mainly for use through TotalCommander as a 'Lister', meaning no panels, 
  and pressing ESC, closes the IDE again)
  
	I have tried to make this build as bug free as possible. Most of the actions in config.xml 
	are still incomplete though. Please let me know if you encounter any serious bugs (and 
	Not implemented dialogs are NOT bugs!). 
 
Known bugs:
- tab handling/painting can get dodgy sometimes [update] issue isolated, bug fix in progress [update]
 
Bugs fixed:
- Debugger files with spaces issue 
- Lexer error in a few files

Betterments:
- Builds are now threaded

Info:
- cspp NEEDS cl (the MS Visual C++ compiler), duh!

0.0.99-preview7   - October 18, 2005

New languages, mostly untested and/or dodgy:
- C++ 
- Caml * 
- SML * 
- Ruby 
- Perl (very dodgy!) 
- Flex 
- Java 
- Javascript 
- Lua * 
- Prolog *
	
	Items marked with * are completely untested.

0.0.99-preview6   - October 17, 2005

- This build fixes Xml problems, and language dll's are built monolithic. This has decreased 
	the size of the zip by 70kb, now only 410kb! (362kb using RAR!!!) More languages in the flavour 
	of perl, java, caml, javascript, lua, ruby, sml and (f)lex coming soon too!

0.0.99-preview5   - October 16, 2005

- Not much extra, except for IronPython highlighting. 

0.0.99-preview4   - October 15, 2005

Usual bug fixes and improvements, and the following new highlighting schemes:
- Plain text 
- XML (some issues) 
- IL 
- Nemerle 
- C 
- Boo

	Also new is the uitlization of the plugin loader system for plugin dll's.

0.0.99-preview3   - October 14, 2005

This preview is mostly bug fixes and cleaning up, but new features include:
- Better project support, integration with codemodel 
- Support for group projects 
- Start on an XML highlighter 
- Memory optimizations 
- Added support lib (extras) that includes Bzip2 compression and Blowfish encryption

0.0.99-preview2   - October 09, 2005

- A surprise for all interested, xacc-ide has now an integrated debugger, support is 
	still very basic (and i need a treeview listview control, something similar to VS locals, 
	autos view). The integrated debugger is a process wrapper aound cordbg.exe. 
 
NOTE:
	For this preview, it expects you to have cordbg.exe in its default location where it is 
	installed with VS.NET 2003. Sorry, I will add paths for SDK once I know what they are . Also 
	debugging will only work on a project, so open up the little demo project in the zip file.

0.0.99-preview    - October 07, 2005

	No project support or anything else for that matter. All that is being demo'd is the new 
	lexing/parsing engine. Open one of the supplied test files to see. No other languages 
	will be displayed correctly, not even plain text until everything has been moved over to 
	the new system. I'm also busy removing redundant code, and refactoring a bit.
