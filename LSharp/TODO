
Class definition facility to be able to subclass existing classes and implement 
existing interfaces.

Build a compiler to generate *.exe or *.dll from an LSharp source.

Build a better inspector that shows properties and state.

Build a CLOS like object system

A bignumber facility for arbitrary length, arbitrary precision numbers and 
arithmentic.

Ensure MONO can be a fully supported platform

Provide an initialisation file - say init.ls which is run when the interpreter
is invoked to allow the user to customise their environment.

Provide a means of persisting one's environment, say (save filename) between 
interpreter sessions.

Write a good L Sharp mode for GNU Emacs.

Implement a wider range of ReaderMacros.

Implement some kind of FASL facility to fast load files.

Some Special Forms and functions should make more use of LSharpExeception to detect 
and handle errors.

When an error occurs, show the line number of the source code file.

Consider whether if, while, cond etc should bind "it" to the result of 
the expression as per ARC.
 
Consider (3 string) as per ARC syntax.

Do we need an unbind or unassign function which removes a binding from the environment?
 
Implement rfn - The recursive function.

Bug - typename collisions are not flagged - you just get the first type found.

How do you get at fields of a class that dont have an accessor method?

Profile the interpreter and look for opportunities for performance optimisation.

Optional and Keyword arguments to closures and macros.
 
How can we write ASP.NET scripts in L Sharp?

MS Visual Studio hosted development.

Consider implementing the notion of setfable forms, and avoiding (set_property object value).

If your brackets dont match you get a stack overflow - we need a more explanatory error message.

Trace should include execution timings.

There are no built in div and mod operators.



DO we need funcall ?

&rest or . Like scheme?

no such method - give more details about types		

SortedList STack and Queue seem to be reversed

Add (Source x)
	
Cant define event handlers for button click because you cant do defmethod. This is
a major problem for WinForms applications.

PS: Could you consider to make a additional framed HTML reference.
(You can take a look at a newer newLISP distribution. There we have a left frame where 
all keyword are listed (and grouped) where you can click a hyperlink and the main window 
jumps to the keyword.)
